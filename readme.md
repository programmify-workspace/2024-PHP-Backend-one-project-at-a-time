# PHP Backend - One Project At A Time

## Introduction

Welcome to the PHP Backend project series! In this series of projects, you will learn how to build various PHP applications by tackling one project at a time. Each project focuses on a specific topic or feature, allowing you to gradually gain a deeper understanding of PHP and its capabilities. Let's get started!

At Programmify, we have developed a comprehensive strategy to help you become proficient in backend development. Our program emphasizes solid knowledge in PHP & Laravel stack or JavaScript & Node.js stack, along with good knowledge of databases. This approach is designed to help our interns develop robust web development skills through practical, hands-on experience.

We call it **PHP Backend - One Project At A Time**. This program comprises 11 projects with user stories, descriptions, and concepts. This is an opportunity for you to leverage your front-end strengths with the backend you are learning.

## Duration

The estimated duration for completing all 11 projects is approximately 30 to 60 days.

## Technologies

You can use any frontend framework or technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6, ES5, ES7), Bootstrap, Tailwind, SCSS, Sass, TypeScript, React, Vue, etc. However, our main focus will be on backend technologies.

For those who selected PHP:

- Main Target: PHP, Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, APIs.

For those who selected Node.js:

- Main Target: Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, APIs.

## Project Structure

The projects are designed to help you gain practical experience in building real-world applications. Each project will have a user story, description, and concepts that you will learn as you build them. Feel free to choose a frontend template that suits the specific project you are working on, allowing you to focus primarily on backend development.
